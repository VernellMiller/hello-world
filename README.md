this is a new repository

I am Vernell Miller. 
I am begining my journey as a Software Developer and I am both excited and super nervous.
I think as of right now JavaScript is what has me the most nervous but I guess that is to be expected.
This may be the toughest thing that I have done but then again working in 3D softwares is pretty tough and Ive been tackling that soooo...

Tomorrow is tha big day. <strong> 9/7/2021 </strong> I start the General Assembly Software Enginnering Immersive Course.

Through all the nerves, I'm going to give it my all and I am anxious to see where I am in this journey 1 year from now...
